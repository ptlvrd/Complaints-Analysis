# Complaints-Analysis

**Description**:  
This project focuses on analyzing complaint data to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights. Using Python and libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, the analysis explores complaint distribution across time (hours of the day, days of the week) and geographic locations. Visualizations such as **correlation matrices**, **density plots**, and **time series charts** are created to provide clear insights into peak complaint periods and high-density areas.

**Features**:  
- **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Used Pandas to handle missing data and prepare datasets for analysis.  
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Analyzed complaints by hour of the day and day of the week to identify reporting trends.  
- **Spatial Analysis**: Created density plots to locate geographic hotspots of complaints based on latitude and longitude.  
- **Correlation Insights**: Identified relationships between numerical variables using a correlation matrix heatmap.  
- **Visualizations**: Developed clear and interactive visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn for better storytelling.

**Tech Stack**:  
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy  

**Outcome**:  
- Identified peak hours and days for complaints to optimize resource allocation.  
- Highlighted geographic hotspots for targeted issue resolution.  
- Provided actionable insights for improving complaint management systems.
